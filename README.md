# SQL_Final_Database_TED_Talks

This repository contains all the final materials from our Final Project in SQL and Relational Databases class during the Fall 2019 Semester.

Our group decided to focus on the TED Talks dataset found on Kaggle.com. The link to the original dataset can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks

The scope of our project is to help a large research organization/university understand the factors that are related to view counts of '
online learning videos.

Our group aims to understand how the client can maximize views for their own online learning videos that will increase their reputation
and prestige.

Since the format of their videos will be similar to TED, we can analyze this dataset to see what worked best for these videos in the past 
and apply it to our own scenario.

The materials in this repository are described below:

-- Two datasets in CSV format (ted_main.csv and transcripts.csv) that are necessary to build our 3NF database

-- The ETL pipeline in Python that was used to convert the data from the two aforementioned spreadsheets into a PostgreSQL database 
on a remote Codio server

-- The Analytical Procedures our team took to explore the data and analyze the relationship of video views and other features in the data

With the materials found in this repository, a consulting team would be well prepared to handle the task at hand for the client engagement.

Next steps for this project may include building a full predictive model using the variables from the Analytical Procedures file.
